		In the project, I have applied CRUD operation using API's which were developed in C#.
		In the "CREATE" page ,once the details are filled the data will be posted/created in database.
		The employee list helps us to retrieve data of all the members oboard and when the "DETAILS" button(present in table of employee list page) is pressed it displays the data of that selected employee.
		On that selected page,the employee can perform functions like Update and delete as well.
		<br>
		
		All the CRUD opertions  are performed dynamically with the help of Local storage concept.
